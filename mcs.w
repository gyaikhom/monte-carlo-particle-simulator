@** Introduction.
The {\it Monte Carlo Simulator}, \.{MCS} in short, is a simulation
package for high-energy physics. It uses Monte Carlo techniques for
the randomised simulation of particle interactions. The system borrows
concepts defined in the Geant4 system; however, they have been
reimplemented using ANSI \CEE/ using new data structures and
algorithms.
